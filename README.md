# LibraryThing
Scripts to extract FMP IDs for exhibitions and artworks out of a LibraryThing tsv export.

Note:
1. TSV exports use pipes to delimit some multivalue field values (Secondary Authors) and commas for others (Language). 
2. Paragraph breaks sometimes, but not always export as "[Return]"
3. Diacritics don't always export correctly and need manual correction ("Fonds régional d'art contemporain" exports as "Fonds reÃÂgional d'art contemporain")
